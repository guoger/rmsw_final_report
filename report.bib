abstract={This paper deals with the distributed averaging problem over a connected network of agents, subject to a quantization constraint. It is assumed that at each time update, only a pair of agents can update their own states in terms of the quantized data being exchanged. The agents are also required to communicate with one another in a stochastic fashion. It is shown that a quantized consensus is reached for an arbitrary quantizer by means of the stochastic gossip algorithm proposed in a recent paper. The expected value of the time at which a quantized consensus is reached is lower and upper bounded in terms of the topology of the graph for a uniform quantizer. In particular, it is shown that these bounds are related to the principal submatrices of the weighted Laplacian matrix. A convex optimization is also proposed to determine a set of probabilities used to pick a pair of agents that leads to a fast convergence of the gossip algorithm.},

	abstract = {In this article we address the problem of counting the number of peers in a peer-to-peer system, and more generally of aggregating statistics of individual peers over the whole system. This functionality is useful in many applications, but hard to achieve when each node has only a limited, local knowledge of the whole system. We propose two generic techniques to solve this problem. The Random Tour method is based on the return time of a continuous time random walk to the node originating the query. The Sample and Collide method is based on counting the number of random samples gathered until a target number of redundant samples are obtained. It is inspired by the "birthday paradox" technique of [6], upon which it improves by achieving a target variance with fewer samples. The latter method relies on a sampling sub-routine which returns randomly chosen peers. Such a sampling algorithm is of independent interest. It can be used, for instance, for neighbour selection by new nodes joining the system. We use a continuous time random walk to obtain such samples. We analyse the complexity and accuracy of the two methods. We illustrate in particular how expansion properties of the overlay affect their performance.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, we have seen a revolution in connectivity between computers, and a resulting paradigm shift from centralized to highly distributed systems. With massive scale also comes massive instability, as node and link failures become the norm rather than the exception. For such highly volatile systems, decentralized gossip-based protocols are emerging as an approach to maintaining simplicity and scalability while achieving fault-tolerant information dissemination. In this paper, we study the problem of computing aggregates with gossip-style protocols. Our first contribution is an analysis of simple gossip-based protocols for the computation of sums, averages, random samples, quantiles, and other aggregate functions, and we show that our protocols converge exponentially fast to the true answer when using uniform gossip. Our second contribution is the definition of a precise notion of the speed with which a node's data diffuses through the network. We show that this diffusion speed is at the heart of the approximation guarantees for all of the above problems. We analyze the diffusion speed of uniform gossip in the presence of node and link failures, as well as for flooding-based mechanisms. The latter expose interesting connections to random walks on graphs.},

	abstract = {Motivated by applications to sensor, peer-to-peer and ad hoc networks, we study distributed asynchronous algorithms, also known as gossip algorithms, for computation and information exchange in an arbitrarily connected network of nodes. Nodes in such networks operate under limited computational, communication and energy resources. These constraints naturally give rise to "gossip" algorithms: schemes which distribute the computational burden and in which a node communicates with a randomly chosen neighbor. We analyze the averaging problem under the gossip constraint for arbitrary network, and find that the averaging time of a gossip algorithm depends on the second largest eigenvalue of a doubly stochastic matrix characterizing the algorithm. Using recent results of Boyd, Diaconis and Xiao (2003), we show that minimizing this quantity to design the fastest averaging algorithm on the network is a semi-definite program ({SDP).} In general, {SDPs} cannot be solved distributedly; however, exploiting problem structure, we propose a subgradient method that distributedly solves the optimization problem over the network. The relation of averaging time to the second largest eigenvalue naturally relates it to the mixing time of a random walk with transition probabilities that are derived from the gossip algorithm. We use this connection to study the performance of gossip algorithm on two popular networks: wireless sensor networks, which are modeled as geometric random graphs, and the Internet graph under the so-called preferential connectivity model.},

The reputation system collects locally generated peer feedbacks and aggregates them to yield global reputation scores. Development of decentralized reputation system is in great demand for unstructured {P2P} networks since most {P2P} applications on the Internet are unstructured. In the absence of fast hashing and searching mechanisms, how to perform efficient reputation aggregation is a major challenge on unstructured {P2P} computing. We propose a novel reputation aggregation scheme called {GossipTrust.} This system computes global reputation scores of all nodes concurrently. By resorting to a gossip protocol and leveraging the power nodes, {GossipTrust} is adapted to peer dynamics and robust to disturbance by malicious peers. Simulation experiments demonstrate the system as scalable, accurate, robust and fault-tolerant. These results prove the claimed advantages in low aggregation overhead, storage efficiency, and scoring accuracy in unstructured {P2P} networks. With minor modifications, the system is also applicable to structured {P2P} systems with projected better performance.},
