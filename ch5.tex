In \cite{jelasity_gossip-based_2005}, convergence factor $E(2^{-\phi})$ is used to determine convergence time, smaller convergence factor results in faster convergence. The Watts-Strogatz is used to model the topology of overlay network, indicating randomness as an independent variable \cite{Watts1998}. Thus, a function is derived, with randomness parameter $\beta$ as input and convergence factor $E(2^{-\phi})$ as output.
