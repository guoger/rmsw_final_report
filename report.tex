\begin{abstract}
In this study we briefly introduce the gossip algorithm and aggregation mechanism. We address the influence of network topologies on the performance of a gossip-based aggregation algorithm. Several analytical studies are discussed. We make two hypothesis regarding the relation between algorithm performance and underlying topologies. A basic gossip-based aggregation is implemented and it's performance is determined in a network emulator. Four different network topologies serve as our conditions. We collect data out of experiments and utilize statistical method to verify our hypothesis.
