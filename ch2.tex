\section{Chapter 1}
\subsection{Gossip-based aggregation algorithm}
Since peer-to-peer and {\it ad hoc} networks are becoming an upward trend, a considerable number of studies have been done regarding gossip-based algorithms. Analytical methods and simulations have been utilized to discuss the relations between performance of gossip protocols and topology of network, namely randomness, connectivity etc. This study is mainly based on the work of M.Jelasity, A.Montresor and O.Babaoglu \cite{jelasity_gossip-based_2005}, focusing on existing static networks of different topologies.\\

\subsection{Applying to real network}
